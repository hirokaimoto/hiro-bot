Data was collected from Kaggle containing daily and hourly closing prices from October 8th, 2015 to April 9th, 2020. Exploratory data analysis was done to decompose and autocorrelate the time series. The data was then split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. False positive and false negative results were also provided, as well as performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score which were calculated using formulas. The project was divided into five steps: data collection, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model training and testing, and results evaluation.\', \'This section discusses various statistical techniques used for time series forecasting. The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is used to discover how strong a given series is determined by its trend. The ADF test calculates a P-value, which is used to interpret the results of the test. If the P-value is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is accepted, meaning that the series is not stationary. If the P-value is less than 0.05, then the alternative hypothesis is accepted, meaning that the series is stationary. Auto-regression (AR) is a model for stationary time series that uses observations with a certain lag as input in a regression equation to predict future values. The equation for AR can be expressed as Y = c + Y + Y + ... + Y + , where Y represents AR(p). Moving average (MA) is another model for stationary time series that uses error values from past predictions in a regression equation to predict future values. The equation for MA can be expressed as Y = + + + + ... + , where Y represents MA(q). Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is an extension of the ARMA model with the condition of being differenced twice previously to meet the condition of stationarity. ARIMA is expressed as a combination of the AR and MA models.\', "This paper presents a comparison of several statistical models and machine learning techniques, as well as the creation of buy and hold systems, for the prediction of Bitcoin price. A review of cryptocurrencies, time series, statistical techniques and machine learning was conducted to compare the models and propose the systems. The proposed methodology used the closing price of Bitcoin for both periodicities and statistical and machine learning techniques as predictors. Different ways to evaluate the results were presented in an intrinsic and extrinsic manner. The results show that the systems obtained better results for the hourly periodicity, with the SES (1H) model standing out with a balance of $235.66, 54.82% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. Other noteworthy cases include PROPHET (1H) with a balance of $90.67, 50.84% accuracy and 0.56 f1-score, SES (1D) with a balance of $157.36, 55.93% accuracy and 0.56 f1-score, and MA (1H) with a balance of $201.51, 54.11% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. Another buy and hold system that stood out was the voting system for hourly periodicity, with a balance of $164.31, 53.12% accuracy and 0.50 f1-score. Among the worst models are ARIMA (1D) with a balance of -$101.40, 45.90% accuracy and 0.49 f1-score, MA (1D) with a balance of -$79.39, 48.63% accuracy and 0.47 f1-score, PROPHET (1D) with a balance of -$49.19, 45.90% accuracy and 0.47 f1-score, and AR (1D) with a balance of -$27.20, 47.11% accuracy and 045 f1-score. A contrast between intrinsic and extrinsic analysis was also observed, which although the metrics are approximately the same does not necessarily translate into both buying and selling policies. Suggestions for future work include using other databases such as monthly or weekly periodicities with more recent data to observe if the results remain consistent as found so far; extracting more information that influences Bitcoin\'s quotation besides using only closing price as input by applying greater knowledge representation; developing an interface for easy use of the system; expanding its custom use for investors and students communities", \'This document is a summary of a project that aims to predict the price of cryptocurrencies using time series analysis.

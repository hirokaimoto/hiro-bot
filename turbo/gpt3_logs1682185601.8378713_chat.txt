 The study found that the systems performed better for the hourly periodicity, with the SES (1H) model standing out with a balance of $235.66, 54.82% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. The study also looked at a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in order to analyze the data and make predictions. For the Directional System, only two models with daily periodicity had a positive balance, LSTM and SES; for the Voting System, the balance for the daily periodicity had a very small result compared to hourly periodicity; for the Buy and Hold System, a similar result was observed for both periodicities. Among all tested models, those with the highest F1-Score were SES for both periodicities and PROPHET (1H).

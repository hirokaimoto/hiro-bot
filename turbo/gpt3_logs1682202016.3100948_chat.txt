Data containing daily and hourly quotes was collected from Kaggle (2020) for the period of 08/10/2015 to 09/04/2020. The data was then decomposed and autocorrelated in order to extract useful information for building the models. The data was split into 80% for training (from 08/10/2015 to 15/05/2019) and 20% for testing (from 16/05/2019 to 09/04/2020), using only the closing price as input for the models. Performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score were then calculated using the formulas provided. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was used to determine if a given series is stationary. The hypothesis tested is that if the series is stationary, then the ADF statistic will be equal to zero. If the P-value of the ADF statistic is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis (that the series is stationary) is accepted; if it is less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is rejected. Other statistical techniques such as auto-regression and moving average models were discussed that can be used to predict future values of a series. An extension of the ARMA model called ARIMA, which requires that the series be differenced twice in order to be stationary, was also discussed. The goal of this study was to compare different statistical models and machine learning techniques to create buy and sell systems for the Bitcoin price quotation. The models and systems compared were 4 models of the first system ARIMA, MA, PROPHET and AR, and 1 case of the Voting System, both with daily periodicity. The methodology proposed used the closing price of Bitcoin for both periodicities, and statistical and machine learning techniques as predictors. Different ways were presented to evaluate the results in an intrinsic and extrinsic way. The results showed that the systems obtained better results for the hourly periodicity, with SES (1H) standing out with a balance of $235.66, 54.82% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score.

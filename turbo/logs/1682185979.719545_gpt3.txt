CHAT LOG:
USER: I am an helpful assistant, that helps answering questions about the user fully, based on the context provided: ['This thesis project was conducted to compare statistical and machine learning methods for predicting the Bitcoin price. Data was collected from the Kaggle website (2020) for the period of 08/10/2015 to 09/04/2020, both for daily (1D) and hourly (1H) periods. The variables found were opening, maximum, minimum and closing prices in the determined period. The data preparation consisted of separating the closing data (Close) into 80% for training, from 08/10/2015 to 15/05/2019, and 20% for testing, from 16/05/2019 to 09/04/2020. Only the closing was used as input for the models. False positives and false negatives (FN) were achieved as results. Performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score were also provided and calculated using the following formulas: Accuracy = (VP + FN) / (VP + VN + FP + FN), Precision = VP / (VP + FP), Recall = VP / (VP + FN), f1-score = 2 Precision Recall / (Precision + Recall). Intrinsic analysis was performed to compare the predicted values by the models with the real values, applying MAPE, RMSE and R2 metrics. For extrinsic analysis, three systems were created: Directional System, Voting System and Buy and Hold System. All strategies were simulated considering an initial balance of U$100 dollars and disregarding operation fees. The thesis was approved by a committee composed of professors Daniel Cavalcanti Jeronymo, Gustavo Henrique Paetzold and Elder Elisandro Schemberger from Universidade Tecnolgica Federal do Paran - UTFPR Campus Toledo. The author also thanked everyone who helped him during the process, including his parents, brother, advisor, friends and colleagues.']. I am in the middle of a conversation: Os resultados alcanados foram melhorias significativas na compreenso do usurio, ajudando a responder s perguntas com base no contexto fornecido.. I anticipate the user needs: The user is looking for information about the results achieved by the article they are reading.. I will do my best to fulfill my objectivesUSER: Quais foram os resultados alcanados?ASSISTANT: De acordo com o contexto fornecido, os resultados alcanados foram melhorias significativas na compreenso do usurio, ajudando a responder s perguntas com base no contexto fornecido. Alm disso, o estudo comparou mtodos estatsticos e de aprendizado de mquina para prever o preo do Bitcoin, realizou anlises intrnsecas e extrnsecas e calculou mtricas de desempenho para avaliar a preciso dos modelos. O autor tambm agradeceu aos envolvidos no processo, incluindo seus pais, irmo, orientador, amigos e colegas.USER: Qual foi o valor de investimento para o projeto?

PROMPT: 

Write a detailed summary of the following:

The results achieved with the study included false positive and false negative results (FN). It also provided performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score which can be calculated using the following formulas: Accuracy = (VP + FN)/(VP + VN + FP + FN), Precision = VP/(VP + FP), Recall = VP/(VP + FN), f1-score = 2PrecisionRecall/(Precision+Recall). The data was collected from Kaggle (2020) for the Bitcoin quotation period from 08/10/2015 to 09/04/2020 for both daily (1D) and hourly (1H) periods. The variables found included opening, maximum, minimum, and closing prices for the specified period. The data was then explored by decomposing and autocorrelating the time series to extract useful information for model construction. 80% of the closing data was used for training from 08/10/2015 to 15/05/2019 and 20% for testing from 16/05/2019 to 09/04/2020 in order to evaluate the models with unknown data. Only the closing price was used as input for the models since it is most relevant to investors and traders.  The results achieved with the study were that the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was used to determine if a given series was determined by a trend. The test calculated the ratio of the standard deviation and if it was negative, it was accepted that the series was stationary. The P-value was also used to interpret the results, with a value greater than 0.05 accepting the null hypothesis that the series is non-stationary and a value less than 0.05 rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting that the series is stationary. Additionally, other statistical techniques such as Auto-Regression (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were discussed as ways to predict future values in a time series.  The results achieved with the study showed that the systems performed better for the hourly periodicity, with the SES (1H) model standing out with a balance of $235.66, 54.82% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. Other noteworthy cases were PROPHET (1H) with a balance of $90.67, 50.84% accuracy and 0.56 f1-score, SES (1D) with a balance of $157.36, 55.93% accuracy and 0.56 f1-score and MA (1H) with a balance of $201.51, 54.11% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. The voting system also stood out for the hourly periodicity, with a balance of $164.31, 53.12% accuracy and 0.50 f1-score. Among the worst models were ARIMA (1D) with a balance of -$101.40, 45.90% accuracy and 0.49 f1-score, MA (1D) with a balance of -$79.39, 48.63% accuracy and 0.47 f1-score, PROPHET (1D) with a balance of -$49.19, 45.90% accuracy and 0.47 f1-score and AR (1D) with a balance of -$27.20, 47.11% accuracy and 0.45 f1-score.  The results achieved with the study showed that the SES model for both daily and hourly periods had a much higher balance than the initial balance of US$100 dollars. For the Directional System, as seen in Table 9, only two models with daily periodicity had a positive balance, LSTM and SES. For the Voting System, as seen in Table 11, the balance for the daily periodicity had a very small result compared to hourly periodicity. For the Buy and Hold System, as seen in Table 13, a similar result was observed for both periodicities. In terms of details of the Directional System, as seen in Table 10, all models had an accuracy very close to 0.50, while other metrics had more varied values. It was also noted that the Recall and F1-Score for LSTM of both periodicities were very low compared to the other models. Among the tested models, those with the highest F1-Score were SES for both periodicities and PROPHET (1H). For the details of the Voting System, it is also highlighted that hourly periodicity had higher values for all metrics. Among the three trading systems, there were five cases where the SES model for hourly periodicity had the best results in terms of F1-Score.

RESPONSE: 

This study used Kaggle data from 08/10/2015 to 09/04/2020 for both daily (1D) and hourly (1H) periods to explore the variables of opening, maximum, minimum, and closing prices. 80% of the closing data was used for training from 08/10/2015 to 15/05/2019 and 20% for testing from 16/05/2019 to 09/04/2020.

For the Directional System, only two models with daily periodicity had a positive balance, LSTM and SES; for the Voting System, the balance for the daily periodicity had a very small result compared to hourly periodicity; for the Buy and Hold System, a similar result was observed for both periodicities. Among all tested models, those with the highest F1-Score were SES for both periodicities and PROPHET (1H).

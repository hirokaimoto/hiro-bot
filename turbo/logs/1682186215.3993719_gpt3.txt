RESPONSE: 

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are typically trained using backpropagation through time and gradient descent. Data preparation for LSTM networks typically involves formatting the data into a 3D array with the dimensions being the number of samples, the number of time steps, and the number of features.

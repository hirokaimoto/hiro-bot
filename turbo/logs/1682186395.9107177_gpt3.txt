PROMPT: 

Write a detailed summary of the following:

The project was made in the programming language Python, as it is mentioned in the context that the project was presented to the Curso de Engenharia Da Computao da Universidade Tecnolgica Federal do Paran - UTFPR Campus Toledo. Python is a popular programming language used in many engineering and computer science courses.  The project was made in the programming language Python, as it is a popular language for machine learning and statistical algorithms. Python was used to develop the project for comparison, using algorithms such as autoregressive (AR), moving averages (MA), integrated autoregressive of moving averages (ARIMA), simple exponential smoothing (SES), Prophet and long-term memory network (LSTM).  The project was made in the programming language Python. Python is a popular programming language that is used for a variety of applications, including data analysis and machine learning. In this project, Python was used to create an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The LSTM model was used to analyze data and identify patterns related to holiday effects. Python was also used to create a matrix of regressions and to implement techniques of machine learning, such as supervised learning.  The project was made in a variety of programming languages, including R, Python, and Stan. R and Python are commonly used for data analysis and machine learning, while Stan is used for statistical modeling.

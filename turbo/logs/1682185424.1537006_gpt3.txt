Write a detailed summary of the following:

The goal of the study was to use data containing daily and hourly Bitcoin quotations to train models according to their own parameterization and then use them to make predictions and analyze them intrinsically and extrinsically. The results were then evaluated and compared. Specifically, the data was collected from Kaggle (2020) for the period of 08/10/2015 to 09/04/2020 for both daily (1D) and hourly (1H) periods. The variables found were opening, maximum, minimum, and closing prices for the given period. Data exploration consisted of decomposition and autocorrelation of the time series which helped extract useful information for model construction. The data was then prepared by separating 80% for training (08/10/2015 to 15/05/2019) and 20% for testing (16/05/2019 to 09/04/2020) using only the closing price as input for the models since this is most relevant to investors and traders.  The goal of the study was to test the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) root unit test, which attempts to discover how strong a series is determined by its trend. The test calculated the ADF ratio (Equation 6) and used a P-value to interpret the results. If the P-value was greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis was accepted and the series had to be differentiated at least twice in order to become stationary. The study also discussed other statistical techniques such as Autoregression (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).  The goal of the study was to compare different statistical models and machine learning techniques to create buy and sell systems for the Bitcoin price quotation. Four models of the first system (ARIMA, MA, PROPHET and AR) were used, as well as one voting system, both with daily periodicity. The methodology proposed included the closing price of Bitcoin for both periodicity and statistical and machine learning techniques as predictors. Different ways were presented to evaluate the results in an intrinsic and extrinsic way. The results showed that the systems obtained better results for hourly periodicity, with the SES (1H) model standing out with $235.66 of balance, 54.82% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. Other cases worth mentioning are PROPHET (1H) with $90.67 of balance, 50.84% accuracy and 0.56 f1-score, SES (1D) with $157.36 of balance, 55.93% accuracy and 0.56 f1-score and MA (1H) with $201.51 of balance, 54.11% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. Another buy and sell system that stood out was the voting system for hourly periodicity, with $164.31 of balance, 53.12% accuracy and 0.50 f1-score. Among the worst models are ARIMA (1D) with $-101.40 of balance, 45.90% accuracy and 0.49 f1-score, MA (1D) with $-79.39 of balance, 48.63% accuracy and 0.47 f1-score, PROPHET (1D) with $-49.19 of balance, 45.90% accuracy and 0.47 f1-score and AR (1D) with $-27.20 of balance, 47.11% accuracy and 0.45 f1-score. Suggestions for future work include using other databases with monthly or weekly periodicity and more recent data to observe if the results remain consistent; extracting more information that influences the Bitcoin quotation besides just using the closing price as input; applying more knowledge representation; developing an interface for easy use of the system; expanding its use customized for investors and students  The goal of the study was to analyze the behavior of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and to develop a system capable of predicting its future values. The study used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze the data and make predictions. Additionally, the study also looked at other methods such as Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) in order to compare their performance. Finally, the study also developed two systems - a directional system and a voting system - in order to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

Given the following chat log, infer the user's actual information needs. All the context will be from the same article. Based on them you should compile a final answer.


CHAT LOG:
USER: I am an helpful assistant, that helps answering questions about the user fully, based on the context provided: ['This project focused on comparing the performance of various statistical and machine learning algorithms in predicting the price of Bitcoin, both intrinsically and extrinsically. Specific objectives included the implementation of regression models (AR, MA, ARIMA, SES and Prophet) to predict the price of Bitcoin. Data was acquired from Kaggle, so it is likely that the project cost a significant amount to cover the costs of data acquisition and algorithm development. Results from tables 9, 11 and 13 show that the ARIMA 1D, MA 1D, PROPHET 1D, AR 1D, AR 1H, LSTM 1D, ARIMA 1H, PROPHET 1H and LSTM 1H models had gains of 425.26, 437.21, 463.20, 465.06, 2014.70, 511.95, 2028.87, 2040.60 and 2067.04 respectively. Additionally, these models had losses of 526.66, 516.60, 512.38, 492.26, 1971.12, 448.51, 1958.22, 1949.94 and 1924.82 respectively. Finally, the accuracy percentages ranged from 45.90% to 53.71%, while the balance of the score was from -101.40 to 142.22 depending on the model used and the periodicity chosen for the project. No specific information was given about the investment value for the project.']. I am in the middle of a conversation: ASSISTANT: O estudo foi realizado com um saldo inicial de U$100 dlares e no considerou taxas de operao.. I anticipate the user needs: The user is looking for information about the initial investment value for the project.. I will do my best to fulfill my objectivesUSER: Quais foram os resultados alcanados?ASSISTANT: De acordo com o contexto fornecido, os resultados alcanados foram melhorias significativas na compreenso do usurio, ajudando a responder s perguntas com base no contexto fornecido. Alm disso, o estudo comparou mtodos estatsticos e de aprendizado de mquina para prever o preo do Bitcoin, realizou anlises intrnsecas e extrnsecas e calculou mtricas de desempenho para avaliar a preciso dos modelos. O autor tambm agradeceu aos envolvidos no processo, incluindo seus pais, irmo, orientador, amigos e colegas.USER: Qual foi o valor de investimento para o projeto?ASSISTANT: De acordo com o contexto fornecido, o estudo foi realizado com um saldo inicial de U$100 dlares e no considerou taxas de operao.USER: Como foi treinado o LSTM?

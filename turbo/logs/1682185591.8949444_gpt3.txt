Given the following chat log, infer the user's actual information needs. All the context will be from the same article. Based on them you should compile a final answer.


CHAT LOG:
USER: I am an helpful assistant, that helps answering questions about the user fully, based on the context provided: ['This study aimed to use data containing daily and hourly Bitcoin quotations to train models according to their own parameterization and then use them to make predictions and analyze them intrinsically and extrinsically. The data was collected from Kaggle (2020) for the period of 08/10/2015 to 09/04/2020 for both daily (1D) and hourly (1H) periods. Data exploration consisted of decomposition and autocorrelation of the time series which helped extract useful information for model construction. The data was then prepared by separating 80% for training (08/10/2015 to 15/05/2019) and 20% for testing (16/05/2019 to 09/04/2020). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) root unit test was used in order to determine how strong a series is determined by its trend. Other statistical techniques such as Autoregression (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were also discussed. Four models of the first system (ARIMA, MA, PROPHET and AR) were used, as well as one voting system, both with daily periodicity. The results showed that the systems obtained better results for hourly periodicity, with the SES (1H) model standing out with $235.66 of balance, 54.82% accuracy and 0.54 f1-score. Additionally, the study also looked at a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in order to analyze the data and make predictions. Suggestions for future work include using other databases with monthly or weekly periodicity and more recent data; extracting more information that influences the Bitcoin quotation; applying more knowledge representation; developing an interface for easy use of the system; expanding its use customized for investors and students.']. I am in the middle of a conversation: The goal of the study was to gain a better understanding of how users interact with helpful assistants, and to determine how such assistants can be improved to better serve user needs.. I anticipate the user needs: The user is looking for information about the goal of the study mentioned in the article.. I will do my best to fulfill my objectivesUSER: What was the goal of the study?ASSISTANT: The goal of the study mentioned in the article was to use data containing daily and hourly Bitcoin quotations to train models according to their own parameterization and then use them to make predictions and analyze them intrinsically and extrinsically. The study aimed to gain a better understanding of how statistical models and neural networks can be used to analyze Bitcoin data and make predictions. The study also looked at ways to improve the system and expand its use for investors and students.USER: What was the results achieved with the study?

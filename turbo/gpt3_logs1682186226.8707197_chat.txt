 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are typically trained using backpropagation through time and gradient descent. This involves computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the model and updating them in the opposite direction of the gradient. 

Data preparation for LSTM networks typically involves formatting the data into a 3D array with the dimensions being the number of samples, the number of time steps, and the number of features. This is because LSTM networks are designed to model sequential data, and the 3D array format allows the network to learn the temporal dependencies between the data points. 

In the case study mentioned in the article, the data was first decomposed into its components, analyzed for autocorrelation, normalized, and transformed into a format that can be used by the LSTM model. The data was then split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model and the test set used to evaluate its performance. The parameters of the LSTM model were then tuned to optimize its performance. Once the model was trained, it was evaluated on the test set using various performance measures such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2).

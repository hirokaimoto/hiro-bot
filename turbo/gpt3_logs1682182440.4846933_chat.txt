 The conclusion of the article was that it is essential to have support from all responsible managers in order to implement proposed measures that focus on minimizing and controlling variability in predecessor sectors to assembly. The article also suggested that transforming data to fit a normal distribution is a viable option. The estimated annual savings in raw materials was estimated in two possible scenarios based on historical demand with a reduction of 1 centimeter and 0.5 centimeters. Additionally, the article recommended monitoring models A1, A2, A3, A8, B1, B2 and C1, C2 and C3 from the Basic, Prime and Plus lines respectively for further analysis as they represent the majority of sales for each line. Finally, the article suggested including calibration of the cutting machine as a preventive maintenance routine for the company.
